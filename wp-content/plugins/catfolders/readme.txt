==⚡️ FEATURES ==
After installing and activating **WP Media Folders**, you will have an integrated folder tree right inside the WordPress media library.

**Unlimited folders**
With WP Media Folders - CatFolders Lite version, you will be able to create unlimited main folders and freely move them to the position you want.

**Import categories from other WP media folders plugins**
Are you considering migrating to CatFolders? We've got it covered! With CatFolders, importing your established folder structure is simple and takes only one click. You will then be able to find your familiar categories in CatFolders-fashion.

**CatFolders** supports easy folder import from these plugins:

1. FileBird by NinjaTeam
2. Enhanced Media Library by wpUXsolutions
3. WordPress Media Library Folders by Max Foundry
4. WordPress Real Media Library by Devowl
5. WP Media Folder by JoomUnited.com
6. HappyFiles by Thomas Ehrig
7. Folders by Premio

**Works with [Media Library Assistant](https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-library-assistant/)**
CatFolders enhances **Media** > **Assistant** admin submenu and supports the `[mla_gallery]` shortcode.
`[mla_gallery mla_catf_folder="120"]`
`[mla_gallery mla_catf_folder="120" attachment_category=mla-category]`

**Drag and drop multiple files**
You can bulk select and drag & drop many files at once to put them in a destination folder. Folders can be bulk selected as well.

**Remember recently opened folder**
CatFolders comes with a variety of options to decide which folder to be opened on your first visit. You can choose to get back to your **most recent folder**, or always back to a specific folder, such as "Uncategorized" or "All files."

**Collapsible folder sidebar**
The sidebar reserved for the folder tree can be collapsed so that you can have the full screen view of WP media library when needed.

**Upload files to a specific folder**
Enhanced media library uploader allows you to choose a folder first, and then upload multiple files from your computer to that folder.

**Works with Grid & List view**
All files in a selected folder are sortable in **list mode**, which means you can easily sort your file list by file name, author, date, and custom post type where they are uploaded to.
In **grid mode**, CatFolders works great both in the media library and in the page/post editor. This helps you choose the media files you need for the work-in-progress content much faster than working with an unorganized media library.

== 😻 WHAT'S THERE IN WP MEDIA FOLDERS PRO? ==

**Advanced sort options**
Once upgraded, you will be able to sort files by file name, created date, modified date, author, newest or oldest, etc. Whether you want to sort files and folders by default, or temporarily, there’s always a sorting method for you.

**Create subfolders**
Each subfolder is a child of the parent folder that is above it. With [CatFolders Pro](https://wpmediafolders.com/), a main folder can hold unlimited subfolders. The parent/child analogy helps you organize your files more efficiently. It's very easy to hide or show all folders below the selected folder.

**Folder access permissions**
Enable global folder structure where everyone sees the same categorization, or set folder permissions based on user roles. Access permissions include add new, view, and edit folders. Recommended for multi-author blogs, multi-vendor marketplace websites, and ecommerce businesses.
